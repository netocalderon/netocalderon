My family, Iris my wife, Carlos my eldest son, Luis the youngest, and I arrived
in Belgium four years ago. My children are both studying Electromechanics,
Carlos in PXL and Luis has been in Secondary School for 4 years. We live in
Hasselt. I have two Bachelor's degrees, one in Civil Engineering and the other
in Marketing, but I also have a passion for computing, I think now is the time
to unite my passion with work.
